 * <h2>Read Core</h2>
 * Clicking on the [#search=core core] link in the top-right navigation
 * will display the most important components of JavaScriptMVC.  Each
 * core page links to most of the associated features.  It's a good place to start looking
 * for something.
 * 
 * <h2>Searching</h2>
 * <p>Type in the input box in the top-left to find the object, class, attribute, function, page
 * or anything else you are looking for.</p>
 * <h2>Use Your Keyboard</h2>
 * <p>This doc application responds to your keyboard.  Use it to quickly search and open your documentation page.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Favorites</h2>
 * Next to every class, attribute, function, etc ... there is a 
 * <span class="favorite favoriteoff" style="background-position: center center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.  Click it
 * to save that page as a favorite.  Your favorites are listed when you click "Favorites" on the top right navigation.
