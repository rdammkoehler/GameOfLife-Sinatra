<h1 class='addFavorite'>New in 2.0</h1>
In order of significance:
<h2>jQuery</h2>
<p>A far cry from the "library interdependance" of 1.5, 2.0 has sold is soul to jQuery.
   It's been great for the project, allowing us to focus on what makes JavaScriptMVC
   different - development tools and architecture.
   
</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
Likely the most effort has gone into JavaScriptMVC's testing.  You can now write your tests and
expect them to run in all browsers, Rhino, and Selenium automatically.


<h2>Documentation</h2>
The most obvious change has been to the new Documentation engine.
