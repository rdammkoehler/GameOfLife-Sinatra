		<ul>Here are the Rules.
			<li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population</li>
			<li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding</li>
			<li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation</li>
			<li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		Just click on any cell on the board to change it's state from alive (red) to dead (black) or back. Then click the 'Step'
		button at the bottom of the game board to execute the rules and see the next board.</br>
